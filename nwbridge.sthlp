{title:Description}

{pstd}
This command calculates the bridges in a network. A bridge is a tie from node i to j, which if removed
makes it impossible to reach node j from node i. A bridge is therefore essential to connect two nodes
with each other.

{pstd} 
In contrast, an edge joining two nodes i and j
in a graph is a local bridge if its endpoints i and j have no friends in common â€” in other
words, if deleting the edge would increase the distance between i and j to a value strictly
more than two. We say that the span of a local bridge is the distance its endpoints would
be from each other if the edge were deleted.

{pstd}
The option {bf:generate()} saves the information about which tie is a bridge (or local bridge)
in a new network {help netname}. When used together with option {bf:local}, the new network saves
the span of the local bridges.
